I created an app that presents concepts specific to OOP in Java which includes : 
Encapsulation, Inheritance , Polymorphism, Overriding, Abstraction, Collections, 
Comparators, etc. The project is a medical office scheduling system application 
where you already logged as a client. The application has a menu in which you can
find options such as: 
  -viewing the current list of medical clinics 
  -viewing informations about a particular clinic 
  -viewing informations about all doctors 
  -we cand create an appointment 
  -see al my appointments 
  -modify the data of an apointment 
  -delete an appointment

The project has been brought to the stage of requirements for stage 1.
